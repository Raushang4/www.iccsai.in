								The ubiquity of information technology and computer power can be applied in many areas ranging from industrial production to everyday. Therefore, it is essential to develop better understandings and design methodologies for large scale pervasive systems for various domains, and societal challenges. Pervasive computing has been greatly supported by the internet of things. The use of internet of things has created the environment that helps in the management of the different modules that are the part of the complete system, which can work effectively without the interference with the other components of the system. The cloud environment with the internet of things can help in getting the greater extend of data sharing. Little attention has been provided to the security of the various stakeholders that are the part of the system. IoT cloud integration involved privacy, security, and personal safety risk of the stakeholders. Not only are these types of security attacks possible, but there is also the possibility of attack on the IoT components like hardware manipulation to disrupt the services. As we are on the network, all the communication attacks of network are also possible. The ever-growing usage of computer systems in a wide variety of fields has generated a large demand of computer professionals. Artificial Intelligence - Human intelligence exhibited by the machines has occupied the glossary of succeeding era of science fiction admirer, computer scientists and medical researchers.

								Intelligent computing systems have revolutionized the way data is analyzedandprocessed in various fields such as healthcare, finance, marketing, and manufacturing. These systems use advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) techniquestoanalyze vast amounts of data and derive valuable insights that can informdecision- making processes. The field of data analysis has been transformed by the emergenceof intelligent computing systems. These systems can performcomplex analysesoflarge data sets in a fraction of the time it would take a human analyst to doso. Thisspeed and efficiency allow businesses and organizations to make data-drivendecisionsmore quickly, giving them a competitive edge in their respective markets. Intelligent computing systems can also be used for predictive analytics, whichinvolvesusing data to make predictions about future events or trends. Predictive analyticscanbe applied in fields such as healthcare, where machine learning algorithms canbeusedto predict patient outcomes or identify individuals at risk of developingcertainconditions. In addition to their speed and efficiency, intelligent computing systems can alsoprovidemore accurate and reliable results than traditional data analysis methods. For example, in medical diagnosis, AI systems can analyze large amounts of patient data andidentifypatterns that may be missed by human doctors. This can lead to more accuratediagnoses and more effective treatments. Despite the many benefits of intelligent computing systems for data analysis, therearealso potential drawbacks to consider.
